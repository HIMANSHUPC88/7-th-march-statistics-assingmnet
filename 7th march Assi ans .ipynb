    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a quick and easy way to\n",
    "describe the spread of a dataset, but it is sensitive to extreme values or outliers. For example, if a dataset contains the \n",
    "values {2, 5, 7, 9, 100}, the range would be 100 - 2 = 98.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is calculated by \n",
    "subtracting each value from the mean, squaring the differences, summing them up, and dividing by the total number of values\n",
    "minus one. A higher variance indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the values \n",
    "are more clustered around the mean. For example, if a dataset contains the values {2, 5, 7, 9, 11},\n",
    "the variance would be ((2-7)^2 + (5-7)^2 + (7-7)^2 + (9-7)^2 + (11-7)^2) / (5-1) = 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a more intuitive measure of how much\n",
    "the values in a dataset vary from the mean. It is useful because it has the same unit of measurement as the original data and\n",
    "is easier to interpret. A higher standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out, while a lower standard deviation \n",
    "indicates that the values are more clustered around the mean. For example, if a dataset contain                                                      s the values {2, 5, 7, 9, 11},\n",

    "While both classes have a median of 70 and a mean of 70, they have different levels of variability.\n",
    "The range of Class A is 20 (80 - 60), while the range of Class B is 40 (90 - 50), indicating that \n",
    "Class B has more spread out test scores. The variance of Class A is 62.5, while the variance of Class B is 200, indicating that \n",
    "Class B has more variability in test scores. The standard deviation of Class A is approximately 7.91, \n",
